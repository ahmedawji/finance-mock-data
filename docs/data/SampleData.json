The fund targets a volatility in the range of 7% to 10%, where 10% is seen as the tail volatility during adverse market conditions. In actively managing the fund's portfolio, the management team seeks exposure to various risk premia strategies that have little or no correlation with each other. The allocation between these strategies is based on continuous bottom-up valuations combined with a focus on short-term market behaviour across asset classes and risk factors. The team also takes both long and short positions and manages currencies actively.The fund mainly invests, directly or through derivatives, in various asset classes such as equities, bonds, money market instruments and currencies from anywhere in the world. Specifically, the fund may invest in equities and equity-related securities, debt securities and debt-related securities, money market instruments, and UCITS/UCIs, including exchange-traded funds. The fund may invest in credit default swaps.The fund may invest in, or be exposed to up to 20% of its total assets in asset- and mortgage-backed securities, The fund may be exposed (through investments or cash) to other currencies than the base currency. The fund may use derivatives and other techniques for hedging (reducing risks), efficient portfolio management and to seek investment gains. The fund may extensively use financial derivatives to implement the investment policy and achieve its target risk profile. A derivative is a financial instrument which derives its value from the value of an underlying asset. The use of derivatives is not cost or risk-free. The fund is subject to Nordea Asset Management's responsible investment policy. The fund uses the EURIBOR 1 M for performance comparison only. The fund's portfolio is actively managed without reference or constraints relative to its benchmark. The fund is denominated in EUR. The value of the fund is directly linked to the value of the underlying investments and will fluctuate accordingly.",

The recommended holding period of the fund is at least 3 years and assumes the fund being the sole or majority holding of the investor. The recommended holding period is primarily based on the historic volatility of the underlying investments. The fund is intended for investors who accept and understand that the value of the fund will fluctuate over time and that the invested amount can be lost entirely. The fund is suitable to investors with basic knowledge of the financial market and instruments.",
      "04040_Investment_objective_Portfolio": "The fund's objective is to provide shareholders with investment growth in the medium to long term. In actively managing the fund's portfolio, the management team selects securities that appear to offer superior investment opportunities. The team also manages currencies actively. The fund mainly invests in government and corporate bonds. Specifically, the fund invests at least two thirds of total assets in debt securities that are issued by public authorities or companies. The fund may be exposed (through investments or cash) to other currencies than the base currency. The fund may use derivatives and other techniques for hedging (reducing risks), efficient portfolio management and to seek investment gains. A derivative is a financial instrument which derives its value from the value of an underlying asset. The use of derivatives is not cost or risk-free. The fund is subject to Nordea Asset Management's responsible investment policy. While the fund compares its performance against the JP Morgan GBI Global – Total Return Index (in EUR), it may freely select the securities that it will invest in. The risk characteristics of the fund's portfolio may bear some resemblance to those of the reference index. The fund is denominated in EUR. The value of the fund is directly linked to the value of the underlying investments and will fluctuate accordingly.",
